# Bharat Herald – Digital Transformation Analysis 📊
This project was completed as part of **Resume Project – Challenge 17 from Codebasics**. The objective was to analyze print circulation, advertising trends, and digital engagement for **Bharat Herald**, a legacy newspaper facing challenges such as declining readership, shifting consumption patterns, and growing competition. Using data analytics, the project provides insights into operational inefficiencies, advertising opportunities, and strategies for digital transformation.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Bharat Herald, a 70-year-old newspaper, is facing an existential crisis in a **post-COVID digital era**.  
Between **2019 and 2024**, print circulation dropped from **1.2M → 560K**.  
Competitors quickly adapted with **mobile-first platforms, WhatsApp delivery, and subscriptions**, but Bharat Herald’s 2021 digital pilot failed due to poor usability.  

This project analyzes Bharat Herald’s **operational, revenue, and digital performance data** to:  
- Quantify what went wrong  
- Identify recovery opportunities  
- Recommend a phased roadmap for **digital transformation**
